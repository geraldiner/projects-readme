## About

This repo holds a `projects.md` file that lists my most recent projects. It's used to update the "Other Projects" section for the README files across almost all my repos. There is a GitHub action tied to this repo that will run whenever `projects.md` is updated and pushed to this repo. It will then automatically update all the other README files.
